# Design Assignment - Isabella's Group 

**This design is made as a group assignment in a Graphic Design course.**

**The assignment was to create a design for a website and then pass the design on to another group who would then code the website based on the design they received.**

**Therefore, the design needed to be clear and specific to ensure that the final result would be as close to the design as possible.**

### About The Design

**It all begun with an image of a beautiful sandy beach with turquoise water in Australia.**


This image was about to set the tone for the whole project including the design. It was used to pick the colors for our color palette.

### From idea to design

We decided to design a page for a travel agency focusing on surfing trips with destinations in Australia for girls. 

The images and the fonts are selected to fit into the rounded tones we have chosen for the page. Even the images and buttons have rounded corners to appear in a soft manner.

The menu differs between different devices; mobile and tablet have a hamburger menu to occupy as little space as possible, while desktop has a menu displayed in the header image in a suitable style.
